            <h3>AUTOMATA</h3>
            <p>Automata Inc. produces specialty vehicles by contract. The company operates several departments, each one of which builds a particular vehicle, such as a limousine, a truck, a van, or an RV.</p>
            <p>When a new vehicle is built, the department places an order with the Purchasing Department to request specific components. Automata's Purchasing Department is interested in creating a database to keep track of orders and to accelerate the process of delivering materials.</p>
            <p>The order received by the Purchasing Department can contain several different items. An inventory is maintained so that the most frequently requested items are delivered almost immediately. When an order comes in, it is checked to determine whether the requested item(s) is (are) in inventory. If an item is not in inventory, it must be ordered from a supplier. Each item may have several suppliers.</p>
            <p>Given this functional description of the processes encountered at Automata's purchasing department, do the following using the crow's foot model:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify all the main entities</li>
                <li>Identify all the relations and connectivities among entities</li>
                <li>Identify if the relationship is strong or weak</li>
            </ol>
