            <h3>What is the difference been a database and a table?</h3>
            <p>A table is a collection of rows of data on a single related topic.<br>
                A database however is a container for the tables, stored procedures, views and functions. We can look
                at a database as a logical container. </p>

            <h3>What does a database expert mean when he or she observes that a database displays both entity integrity
                and referential integrity?</h3>
            <p>Referential Integrity is the state in which all values of all foreign keys are valid. Entity integrity
                requires that each entity has a unique key. This means you have no repeating ids and no repeating
                foreign ids. Everything is working as intended.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Why are entity integrity and referential integrity important in a database?</h3>
            <p>Entity Integrity is important because all primary key entries are unique, and no part of a primary key may be null</p>

            <h3>The nulls in the CHARTER table's CHAR_COPILOT column indicate that a  copilot is not necessarily  required  for  some  charter  trips  or  for  some  aircraft.  (Federal  Aviation  Administration rules require a copilot on jet aircraft and on aircraft having a gross take-off  weight  over  12,500  lbs.  (None  of  the  aircraft  in  the  AIRCRAFT  table  is  governed  by  this requirement; however, some customers may require the presence of a copilot for insurance reasons.)

            <p>Foreign key(s):AC_NUMBER is on the first CHARTER linking to AIRCRAFT, MOD_CODE from AIRCRAFT and MODEL, EMP_NUMBER linking PILOT and EMPLOYEE, CUS_CODE is linked from CUSTOMER to CHARTER, AC_NUMBER is linked to CHARTER from AIRCRAFT</p>

            <h4>Note: Database design properly precedes the creation of table structures and contents.However, when learning database design, sometimes it much easier to understand design concepts and requirements after examining some data. By observing actual attribute values, the abstract notion of relationships becomes "real" and, therefore, more easily understood. So, throughout this lesson and in the lessons question and problem sets, we have shown the table structures and contents first and then the E-R diagram is constructed to reflect the available information.</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><h4>a CUSTOMER can request many CHARTER trips, but each CHARTER trip is requested by one CUSTOMER.</h4></li>
                <li><h4>each CHARTER trip requires one AIRCRAFT, but an AIRCRAFT may be used to fly many different CHARTER trips.</h4></li>
                <li><h4>each AIRCRAFT is of a certain MODEL and, because the charter company may have many aircraft of a given model, each MODEL may reference many AIRCRAFT.</h4></li>
                <li><h4>each PILOT is an EMPLOYEE (but not all EMPLOYEEs are PILOTs!)</h4></li>
