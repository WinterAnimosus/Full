            <h3>What is the difference been a database and a table?</h3>
            <p>A table is a collection of rows of data on a single related topic.<br>
                A database however is a container for the tables, stored procedures, views and functions. We can look
                at a database as a logical container. </p>

            <h3>What does a database expert mean when he or she observes that a database displays both entity integrity
                and referential integrity?</h3>
            <p>Referential Integrity is the state in which all values of all foreign keys are valid. Entity integrity
                requires that each entity has a unique key. This means you have no repeating ids and no repeating
                foreign ids. Everything is working as intended.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Why are entity integrity and referential integrity important in a database?</h3>
            <p>Entity Integrity is important because all primary key entries are unique, and no part of a primary key may be null</p>
