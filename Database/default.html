        <h3>What is a database?</h3>
        <p>A database is any collection of data or information designed for storage and retrieval by a computer. Some may look at a database as a spreadsheet however it is not just one single spreadsheet but multiple with relationships drawn between them.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>And what is one we may have used</h3>
        <p>Common databases could be anything, every company that stores information requires a database, for logging in, sending messages (if you didn't know, social media keeps every message you send, deleted or not) and even purchases on places like Amazon.</p>

            <h3>Explain why database design is important?</h3>
            <p>Database design is important for making it as fluid and compact as possible, without wasting company resources on space on the server for overly verbose data.</p>
            <p>If you created your database as scalable, then should the amount of data required to input increase or decrease, the size of the database will scale to match.</p>
