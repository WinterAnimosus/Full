        <h3>What is a database?</h3>
        <p>A database is any collection of data or information designed for storage and retrieval by a computer. Some may look at a database as a spreadsheet however it is not just one single spreadsheet but multiple with relationships drawn between them.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>And what is one we may have used</h3>
        <p>Common databases could be anything, every company that stores information requires a database, for logging in, sending messages (if you didn't know, social media keeps every message you send, deleted or not) and even purchases on places like Amazon.</p>

                <h4>Data</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data in the context of databases refers to all the single items that are stored in a database. This information has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A field is part of a record and contains a single piece of data for the subject of the record.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Database is stored in records; a record is composed of fields and contains all the data about one person or thing.</li>

            <li>
                <h4>File</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can think of a traditional database as an electronic filing system, generally files are contained audio/video, graphic or text information dictated by the program that created it and can only be read or used by the same program.</li>

            <h3>What is a DBMS?</h3>
            <p>A database management system.</p>
            <h3>And its functions?</h3>
            <p>A DBMS is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.</p>

            <h3>Explain why database design is important?</h3>
            <p>Database design is important for making it as fluid and compact as possible, without wasting company resources on space on the server for overly verbose data.</p>
            <p>If you created your database as scalable, then should the amount of data required to input increase or decrease, the size of the database will scale to match.</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between Data, Information, and a Database?</h3>
            <p>Data, is information that is yet to be organized.</p>
            <p>Information, is data parsed into manageable bits, for humans to read and check.</p>
            <p>A Database, is a system to store a collection of data</p>

            <h3>How many records does the table contain and how many fields are there per record?</h3>
            <p>Fields-5 (columns or attributes)</p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Problems would you encounter if you wanted to produce a listing by city?</h3>
            <p>You would run into one major problem, the formatting in the “manager_address” is not properly written.</p>
            <h3>How would you solve this problem by altering the structure above?</h3>
            <p>You could delete the full address and only leave the city in the “manager_address” or create a new field named “city”.</p>

            <h3>If you wanted to produce a listing of the table contents by last name, area code, city, state, or zip code how would you alter the table structure above?</h3>
            <p>In order to produce a listing of table contents by search criteria given above you would need to separate the last name, area code, city, state and zip code all in there respective fields.</p>

            <h3>What data redundancies do you detect, and how could these redundancies lead to anomalies?</h3>
            <p>We have a few redundancies here, we have a couple people with more than 1 bid. Should someones name be misspelt, then a few errors could occur such as later on, such as the manager not having both projects</p>

            <h3>Identify and discuss the serious data redundancy problems exhibited by the table structure.</h3>
            <p>Firstly, it should be manager name not employee name. Employees should have their own tables for projects and everything after project name should be in its own separate employee table.</p>
            <h3>Looking at the EMP_NAME and EMP_PHONE contents in the figure above, what change(s) would you recommend?</h3>
            <p>EMP_NAME and EMP_PHONE should be in an employee table.</p>

            <p>The BUILDING_CODE Is repeated due to the building having multiple teachers in it at a time. The ROOM_CODE also has different people in them at different times, Teachers will teach multiple times so they show up multiple times, Risell also doesn't have a middle name, and multiple initial's are repeated, as well as the times being repeated.</p>
            <h3>Given the table structure shown in the figure above, what problem(s) might you encounter if you deleted building KOM?</h3>
            <p>you would lose more information then intended, and would lose teachers.</p>
