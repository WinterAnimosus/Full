				mwilliams:  Added for Responsive Design:
				- Use the meta viewport tag to control the width and scaling of the browser's viewport.
				- Include width=device-width to match the screen's width in device-independent pixels.
				- Include initial-scale=1 to establish a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels.
				- Ensure your page is accessible by not disabling user scaling 
	 			 maximum-scale=1 would disable scaling.
	  			Note:  Not all mobile browsers handle orientation changes in the same way. For example, Mobile Safari often just zooms the page when changing from portrait to landscape, instead of laying out the page as it would if originally loaded in landscape. If web developers want their scale settings to remain consistent when switching orientations on the iPhone, they must add a maximum-scale value to prevent this zooming, which has the sometimes-unwanted side effect of preventing users from zooming in:

				<h2>Our Shops</h2>
				<p>They are real reflections of the communities that they're in. Many of our shops hang local art and play local music. Free WI-FI is available in all but a few locations.</p>
				<p>And, unlike others, our shops smell like coffee. If you have ever been in a CoffeeBuzz coffee House, you know what we're talking about. It's the benefit of roasting every day, right in the shop.</p>
