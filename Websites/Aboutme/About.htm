        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Nathan Brennan.
            Yet you may know me as Winter Animosus. This is the name I use for my online activitys, and
            as coding websites is most certainly an online activity, I shall refer to myself as Winter Animosus for all future references.
        </p>
        <h2>Where Am I from?</h2>
        <p>
            Im from a small place called Moncton, located in Newbrunswick Canada. There really isnt much to say. Its a small little city without much to do,
            or atleast nothing that I found. Then again I spend all my time on a computer, so I didnt really go about exploring the place.
